# JinnTap and Annotation editor


## Create a new file
Different ways to create new TEI-XML documents:
* upload an XML file via the upload widget
* upload a MS Word document, which will then be converted to TEI-XML
* edit from scratch with JinnTap 

## Annotations

JinnTap requires a schema. Out of the box, the default schema supports:
* block level elements like headings, paragraphs, lists 
* elements for inline formatting like `<hi>` or `<title>`
* semantic markup for people, organizations, places, terms
* analytic elements like `<date>`
* footnotes
* inline nodes representing an alternative like `<choice>`, `<abbr>`, `<expan>`
* figures, figure descriptions and graphics

Adding annotations with JinnTap (bleeding edge) vs Annotations Editor

## Individual assignment

1. create a new XML document with one of the methods mentioned above. Please name the file after yourself (no spaces or brackets in the filename)
2. add dates, abbreviation expansions and other relevant elements
3. try out the annotation of place and person names
4. switch to then Annotation Editor to be able to add and link entity references with local registers
