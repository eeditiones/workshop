## Preparation

Due to the large number of attendees we encourage more experienced users to install eXist-db and TEI Publisher 6 on their machines. 
The basic steps are described in the [TEI Publisher documentation](https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/doc/documentation.xml?id=installation).

If you run into difficulties we may be able to help during the opening session, please describe your issues via Slack. Nevertheless, if troubleshooting proves too time-consuming we will ask you to work on the shared server instead.

As a fallback you can use the shared workshop server to work on the exercises.  All you need is a decent web browser (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari work; the latest Edge on Windows works despite being slow; and IE definitely doesn't). The address of the server is:
