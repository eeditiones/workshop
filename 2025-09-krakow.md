# 25th Annual Conference of the Text Encoding Initiative
# Jinks workshop plan

## Opening round

- Introduction of participants and tutors
- Previous experience with TEI Publisher, TEI Processing Model, other publication infrastructures

## Jinks: motivations and rationale

- TEI Publisher-generated applications need upgrading as new versions are released
- Users might want to change the configuration at a later date
- Users would benefit from extended configuration options
- Single blueprint for generated app for all is insufficient: many editions share multiple features but there are no distinct paradigms or fixed types of editions anymore
- In the body of TEI Publisher-based editions, implementations of various features exist. Nevertheless it's not necessarily
easy to replicate them into a different project because of all the orchestration layers that need to be taken into account: from data encoding in TEI and organisation across data packages, collections, files etc, to API endpoints, Query modules, Lucene index configurations, HTML templates, web components, to CSS styling
- Solution: full-blown application manager we called Jinks

### Conceptual vs implementation blocks in Jinks

- Base
- Features
- Themes
- Blueprints

vs

- Profiles (with necessary resources prepared for seamless integration into the base)

## Jinks installation

Let’s click around and install Jinks into eXist-db

We’re running pre-release versions so not everything is available as a package through eXist’s public repository. Prepared XAR packages are available below:

- [tei-publisher-lib 5.0.0]()
- jinks-templates
- [jinks]() 

### Logging in

user: tei 
password: simple

This is also the default user for generated applications

## Part 1:  Show and tell

- Generate empty base app
- Works, but nothing’s there
- Add upload feature and use it to add one of Laks letters (the one with images)
- View letter
- Add the landing page
- Look at the TEI encoding
- Add IIIF feature

### Download/synchronize

Show synchronisation to filesystem and source control repository on GitHub

## Part 2: Hands-on

- Ask users to click the same themselves: upload, iiif, landing page, upload the document
- Check if it works
- Switch the viewer through Jinks configuration
- Switch the colour palette
- Remove query/login from the menu bar
- Add edition introduction XML to articles (we can switch momentarily the data default so it lands in the correct spot)
- Add menu option linking to the introduction

## Explanation of Jinks configuration

- config.json structure overview
- feature configuration and documentation

## Part 3: It all starts with the data

- Install the Karl Barth / Laks data package into eXist (via package manager)
- Using the same Jinks config as before, change the data and data default to use the external data package
- Add registers feature and timeline
- Decide if we want registers in the document view or not (configure the template front matter?)
- KB has no facsimile so we can disable that feature

## Part 4: Customise the landing page

- Upload new hero image and configure the theme to use it
- Switch TEIPublisher logo to editiones
- Change some of the i18n labels for hero image
- Add a team member (upload profile image and text)
- Observe regeneration conflict

## Update options

- Quick
- Full
- Factory reset
- Reindex
- Fix-Odds

## Add new ODD to the app and use it

- Create some special rule missing from TEI Publisher
- Apply fix odds
