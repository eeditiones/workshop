## Assignments

### MS Word import and annotation

#### Using MS Word styles for annotation

* The file [test.docx](data/ms-word/test.docx) is a sample that shows how you can make annotations in MS Word using style so that they get transformed into TEI elements.
* The document [cuento.docx](data/ms-word/cuento.docx) contains already two types of styles: a paragraph style to create the TEI element `<head>`, and a inline style that will be processed as a TEI element `<title>`.
* If you have MS Word, you can add annotations using the style functionality. 
* Open the TEI Publisher app, click on “Playground” and import the MS Word document **after you change its name adding your name or initials**.
* Open the edition of the text, and then open the generated TEI-XML file.

#### Annotation in TEI Publisher
* Open the TEI Publisher app, click on “Annotation Samples” and import a MS Word document, e.g. [letter.docx](data/ms-word/letter.docx) **after you change its name adding your name or initials**.
* Open the document to annotate some of the named entities (e.g. “Thom”, “Elaine”).
* Save the annotations and open the generated TEI-XML file. Then open the register file: Open `eXide` > `Directory` (left side panel) > `tei-publisher` > `data` > `registers` > `persons.xml`

### Creating a web application
* Open the TEI Publisher app, make sure that you are logged in, and on the top menu click on `Admin` > `App generator`.
* Fill in the form (wait for instructions)
* Save and open the new app
