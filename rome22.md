# Exercise

- [ ] Create a Word document for a recipe with a basic structure, using heading styles and lists

```
Heading1: Name of the dish
  Heading2: Ingredients
       - ingredient 1
       - ingredient 2
       ...
       
  Heading2: Preparation
  
  ...
  
```

- [ ] Upload these word documents into Annotation playground on the demo server

- [ ] Open your uploaded document and mark up ingredient names with `term` annotation, resolving against GND (remember you need to look it up via German name of the ingredient)
